# ups-battery-anomaly-detection
Physics-informed anomaly detection for UPS battery strings using multivariate calculus. Computes the Jacobian (dV/dI) for real-time impedance and the Hessian (d²T/dt²) as a thermal runaway leading indicator, with Taylor Series voltage forecasting. Multi-criteria alerting fires 45s before traditional temperature alarms.
